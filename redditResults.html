I'm curious what the spread of opinions around these parts is; I've noticed that this sub in particular tends to be a wee bit more critical with regards to that process than most. And to be clear, by "technical interview" I mean the whole process of asking individuals a series of questions about the fundamentals of CS, algorithms, or coding on the whiteboard.
<span id="line1167"></span>
<span id="line1168"></span>My own opinion? It's not a good way to recruit and one I think should never be used. Endless false positives, false negatives, and poor correlation between merit as an employee and technical interview performance.

<span id="line1750"></span>                                            [selftext] =&gt; I started working at a pretty well known company a few months ago, and since then, a lot of bootcampers have reached out to me about referring them to open New Grad roles at my company. 
<span id="line1751"></span>
<span id="line1752"></span>But from what I’ve noticed, my company definitely does not have bootcampers in that role and it’s filled mostly by recent grads from universities. 
<span id="line1753"></span>
<span id="line1754"></span>Is this common at other companies too? Would you consider a bootcamper for a new grad role? You would think that that’s where they belong in terms of experience 🤔
<span id="line1755"></span>
<span id="line1756"></span>I feel kinda bad having to tell them that their background is not good enough :(

I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve always enjoyed computers and initially went to school for information systems, but dropped out quickly, then enrolled at a community college to quickly get an associate<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;s degree in programming. For some strange reason, I didn<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t work very hard to get a job right away when I first graduated back in 2013. I guess it was sort of like I was postponing adulthood or something... I don<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t know.... I just moved back home when that happened, and always thought I wouldn<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t be able to find a job in that field in the small area I had grown up in.
<span id="line1930"></span>Anyway, I live in a rural area as you can tell where it<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;s very hard to find a job as a programmer, but would be willing to relocate - even to a bigger city, I just don<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t think I could ever live in a massive tech/population hub area like in California or New York. It<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;s just not me. My resume has no programming jobs on it, just an internship I did at the community college I went to, but I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve been working on a game in Unity in my spare time and have a link to that on the resume. I may be partial, but I think the stuff I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve done is actually pretty impressive, especially the enemy AI that does some pretty nifty things. All that said, I have a few questions and anyone taking time out to answer me would be doing me a huge favor. Programming isn<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t my be-all end-all. I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve considered a lot of things like health care and the trades for example, but I don<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t think I would fit in with the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>quot;salt-of-the-earth<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>quot; people that the trades attract, and I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;m tired of all the <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>quot;sure-fire<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>quot; health care careers that I look into and find out that they<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve gone bust in my area because colleges pump out graduates (I think this has happened to ct/mri tech in my area, which was something I was really banking on). So here are the questions: 1) Anyone know much about programming/software development outside populated areas? Is it still in demand in slightly less populated areas? Are the hiring criteria more or less stringent?
<span id="line1931"></span>2) You hear a lot of conflicting info about computer programming. I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve heard that if you can program your way out of a wet paper bag you can get a job, and also heard the exact opposite.
<span id="line1932"></span>3) If I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve gone 3 or 4 years since graduating with no programming job, is that going to be a problem with me getting a job? Any suggestions if so?
<span id="line1933"></span>4) Anyone know if it<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;s even possible now to get a job with an associate<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;s degree in this field?
<span id="line1934"></span>5) I don<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t have to work in computers. I had a long-standing idea that I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;d go into ct/mri tech at my local university. I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;ve heard the radiological sciences including sonography and ct/mri tech are more saturated than all the job articles let on. For Christ sake though I need to figure something out. Should I just throw caution to the wind and do that instead? I<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;m sick of all the research ad nauseam!

I set up a time to talk with the recruiter and she called on time. The screening was really awkward.

This wasn<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t just a simple quick question because they talked for a solid 2/3 mins and then he left the room. My interviewer said <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>quot;Sorry about that. We<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;re kinda busy right now so I had to answer that.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>quot; I said sure and I picked up where I left off. Granted I had to tell him my whole train of thought again since he forgot what I had said. 10 mins later that same coworker barged in and decided to have another 2/3 min conversation with my interviewer. My interviewer introduced him to me, what his role was within the company, and what the issue he had was. I was polite and acted like I cared. The interview itself resembled a bad tinder date. Instead of asking purely technical questions, like the recruiters told me, it was more like asking a single AWS question and the rest was a behavioral interview. <span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>lt;</span>/p<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>gt;</span>

I emailed one recruiter and she said that I should email the other recruiter because she knew more about the timeline. I emailed the other recruiter and no response. It was 3 weeks now since the technical interview and still no word. I emailed my interviewer, since he had given me his work email, and even he didn<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>amp;</span>#39;t respond. After about a month of waiting, I saw that the position had been taken down from their careers site and so I assumed it had been filled.<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>lt;</span>/p<span class="entity"><span>&amp;</span>gt;</span>
